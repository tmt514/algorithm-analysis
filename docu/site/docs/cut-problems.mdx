# Graph Cuts

## Linear Arrangment of Vertices

:::info[Minimum Cut Linear Arrangment Problem]

Given an undirected unweighted grpah $G=(V, E)$, find a permutation $\sigma$ of all vertices $\sigma(1), \sigma(2), \ldots, \sigma(n)$,
such that $\max_{i=1}^{n-1} |\partial X_i|$ is minimized, where $X_i := \{\sigma(1), \ldots, \sigma(i)\}$.

:::

### Intractability

First, this problem is NP-hard.

### Exact Algorithms

* Naive algorithm: $O(n\cdot n!)$.
* Straightforward Dynamic Programming: $O(m2^n)$, can be improved to $O(m+n2^n)$.

### Approximate Algorithms

:::tip[Leighton-Rao 1988]

1. Find a $\rho$-approximate solution $(V_1, V_2)$ to the minimum bisection problem.
2. Recurse on $G[V_1]$ and $G[V_2]$.

:::

The above algorithm returns an $O(\rho\log n)$-approximate solution to the minimum cut linear arrangement problem.
